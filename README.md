Kriegel, H.-P., Renz, M., & Schubert, M. (2010). Route skyline queries: A multi-preference path planning approach. 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010). doi: 10.1109/icde.2010.5447845

The implementation of two route skyline queries on multi-attribute road networks. The algorithms that are called Basic Route Skyline Computation (BRSC) and Advanced Route Skyline Computation (ARSC) are defined on the paper as pseudocode. In this repository, there are implementations for [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) platform which is a graph database management system.
